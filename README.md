## Project Overview


For this project, I made a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. After taken the quiz players' scores will be stores and compared.

2. Timer start when play click "Start Quiz".
3. Quiz end when timer hit 0 or player finished answer all the questions. 
4. Score then is calculated base on number of correct question answered * number of seconds left.
